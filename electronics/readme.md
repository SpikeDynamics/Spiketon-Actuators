We haven't developed our electronics yet. Instead, we used 3rd-party drivers and generators to test the electromechanical capabilities of the Spiketons (multistep), rotational (R1), and amplified actuators (AA1, AA2).

Here we will describe our experience with these 3rd-party electronics. Don't consider this as an advertisement.
