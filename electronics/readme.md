We haven't developed our full-feathered electronics yet. Instead, we used 3rd-party drivers and generators to test the electromechanical capabilities of the Spiketons (multistep), rotational (R1), and amplified actuators (AA1, AA2).

Here we will describe our experience with these 3rd-party electronics. Please don't think this is an advertisement.

We will also publish the Spike Dynamics boards here for conducting experiments and testing. Stay tuned.
