Spiketon M2 is a compact, lightweight, high-precision, simple linear actuator with a carriage moving along a single rail.

Guided Spiketon M1 is a Spiketon Actuator for moving the carriage (the body of the device) back and forth along the rail. 

Front and rear jaws grip the rail at the appropriate time. 


The movement along the rails looks like this:

- grip by rare jaws
- extend the middle part
- grip by the front jaws
- release rare jaws
- contract the actuator's body by side springs
- repeat

Materials:
 - Steel
 - Titanium Alloy Grade 5


   
   What to choose:
- Steel, when you need the cheapest solution. You need plasticity and hardness at the same time.
- Titanium Alloy Grade 5, when you need a non-magnetic device and some degree of biocompatibility.


  How to cut
  - Wire EDM is the best choice for manufacturing the device
  - CNC is a choice for big actuators. We tried using CNC for small actuators but failed. It is not easy.
  - Laser cutting - not recommended
  - Water jet - it is possible, but not for small actuators.
  - Water jet + Laser cutting - the best approach. It is also the best approach, but the cutting equipment is expensive.
  - 3D-printing - we never tried, but maybe
  - Die cutting (blanking) -  it's a good method to make small, non-expensive actuators (mass production)

  M2 comprises the metal frame having two outstanding jaws.
  
  

  The size and force depend on the type of piezostacks used.
   In our experiments, we used piezo stacks of Piezo Instrumente and Thorlabs.

  The output force depends on the cross-sectional area of a piezostack. Even a small piezostack with 2mm*3mm can produce a force of up to 180N. For the project, this means you may use 2mm or 3mm metal sheet for implementation. If you need to implement an actuator with a great force, you have to use actuators with 5mm*5mm, 7mm*7mm or even 15mm*15mm. The last one will provide you with a force of approximately 6000N or even more in a very small size and weight.

  The output force also depends on the friction between the jaws and the rod.

  The difference between M1 and M2. Due to the outstanding jaws, M2 is a little more complicated to implement. It is not enough just to cut the body from a metal plate; it is necessary to implement jaws by welding or other methods.
