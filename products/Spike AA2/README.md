Amplified Linear Actuator Spike AA2

AA2 is a lightweight amplified actuator that moves the tip up to 0.5mm-1mm with a pushing force of up to 1000N and operates at high frequency. It can be used as a standalone product or as a part of a more complex product (like Spiketon).

The difference between AA2 and AA1 is in their design purposes. AA1 has been designed to ba as simple as possible. While AA2 is more advanced, it comes with a more complex assembly.
