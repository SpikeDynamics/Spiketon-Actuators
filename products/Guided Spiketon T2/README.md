Guided Spiketon T2
Guided Spiketon T2 is a Spiketon Actuator for moving back and forth along a rod or a wire (guide). 

Front and rare clamps grip the wire at the appropriate time. This design has its advantages and disadvantages. 
  Advantages: very simple and easy to implement.
  Disadvantages: Piezo stacks require a central hole (this is a bit more expensive). The jaws here are wearing out quickly. The metal frame is also subject to wear.
