Guided Spiketon T1 is a Spiketon Actuator for moving the rod (guide) back and forth along the actuator body. 

Front and rear clamps grip the wire at the appropriate time. 


The movement along a wire or a rod looks like this:

- grip by rare clamps
- extend the middle part
- grip by front clamps
- release rare clamps
- contract the actuator's body by side springs
- repeat

Materials:
 - Steel
 - Titanium Alloy Grade 5
 - Nitinol
 - Ceramics
   
   What to choose:
- Steel, when you need the cheapest solution. Keep in mind that steel is a magnetic material. You need plasticity and hardness at the same time.
- Titanium Alloy Grade 5, when you need a non-magnetic device and some degree of biocompatibility.
- Nitinol, when you need biocompatibility
- Ceramics - never use ceramics.

  How to cut
  - Wire EDM is the best choice for metal
  - CNC is a choice for big actuators. We tried to use CNC for small actuators and failed. It is not easy.
  - Laser cutting - not recommended
  - Water jet - it is possible, but not for small actuators.
  - Water jet + Laser cutting - the best approach. It is also the best approach, even for ceramics
  - 3D-printing - we never tried, but maybe
  - Die cutting (blanking) -  it's a good method to make small, non-expensive actuators (mass production)

  T1 comprises the metal frame, two jaws, and 1 or 2 outstanding elements (holders with a hole)
  Only a 3D printer allows for making the frame as a whole. Other methods demand welding.

  The size and force depend on the type of piezostacks used.
   In our experiments, we used piezo stacks of Piezo Instrumente and Thorlabs.

  The output force depends on the cross-sectional area of a piezostack. Even a small piezostack with 2mm*3mm can produce a force of up to 180N. For the project, this means you may use 2mm or 3mm metal sheet for implementation. If you need to implement an actuator with a great force, you have to use actuators with 5mm*5mm, 7mm*7mm or even 15mm*15mm. The last one will provide you with a force of approximately 6000N or even more in a very small size and weight.

  The output force also depends on the friction between the jaws and the rod.

    Please ask us about these things if you need more information.
