Spiketon M1 is a simple, compact, lightweight, high-precision, linear actuator that moves a carriage along rails.

Guided Spiketon M1 is a Spiketon Actuator for moving the carriage (the body of the device) back and forth along the rails. 

Front and rear clamps grip the rails at the appropriate time. 


The movement along the rails looks like this:

- grip by rare clamps
- extend the middle part
- grip by front clamps
- release rare clamps
- contract the actuator's body by side springs
- repeat

Materials:
 - Steel
 - Titanium Alloy Grade 5


   
   What to choose:
- Steel, when you need the cheapest solution. You need plasticity and hardness at the same time.
- Titanium Alloy Grade 5, when you need a non-magnetic device and some degree of biocompatibility.


  How to cut
  - Wire EDM is the best choice of manufacturing the device
  - CNC is a choice for big actuators. We tried to use CNC for small actuators and failed. It is not easy.
  - Laser cutting - not recommended
  - Water jet - it is possible, but not for small actuators.
  - Water jet + Laser cutting - the best approach. It is also the best approach, even for ceramics
  - 3D-printing - we never tried, but maybe
  - Die cutting (blanking) -  it's a good method to make small, non-expensive actuators (mass production)

  M1 comprises the metal frame having two clamps(two pairs of legs)
  

  The size and force depend on the type of piezostacks used.
   In our experiments, we used piezo stacks of Piezo Instrumente and Thorlabs.

  The output force depends on the cross-sectional area of a piezostack. Even a small piezostack with 2mm*3mm can produce a force of up to 180N. For the project, this means you may use 2mm or 3mm metal sheet for implementation. If you need to implement an actuator with a great force, you have to use actuators with 5mm*5mm, 7mm*7mm or even 15mm*15mm. The last one will provide you with a force of approximately 6000N or even more in a very small size and weight.

  The output force also depends on the friction between the jaws and the rod.

    Please ask us about these things if you need more information.
